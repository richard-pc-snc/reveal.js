				<section><h2>Step 0 -</h2><h1>The Problem</h1></section>
				<section>
					<p>Ms Drouillard is French Teacher. She has between 7 and 10 students in her class. 
						She sets tests every week that are scored out of 30.</p>
					<p>Students must acheive a score of at least 10 to pass each test and points are only recorded if the student passes the test.</p>
					<p>Students heed to achieve a total of 50 points to pass the course.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>She has asked you to make a system that does the following:
						<ul>
							<li>Holds the names of all students in the class.</li>
							<li>Allows her to enter a grade for ever student each week.</li>
							<li>Increase the total points for students who passed the test.</li>		
							<li>Produces a list of students who have complete the course.</li>
						</ul>					
					</p>

				<section><h2>Step 1 -</h2><h1>Data Structures</h1></section>			
				<section><h2>Thinking Points</h2></section>
				<section>The first task is to decide on the Data Structures you will need. Can you list out what is needed?</section>
				<section>Think about the variables you will need. Can you name these so they match the scenario?</section>
				<section>Next what data type will be best? Do you have enough information to get specific about data types? Or do you need to use data types that allow more of a range of information to be entered.</section>
				<section>Will each variable hold one piece of information or a set? </section>		
				<section><h2>Building Points</h2></section>
				<section>You will need to hold information on
					<ul>
						<li>Students Names</li>
						<li>Test Scores</li>
						<li>Test Counts</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>I would make 3 variables 
					<ul>
						<li>studentNames</li>
						<li>testScores</li>
						<li>testCounts</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					All three will be arrays to hold more than one item.
				</section>
				<section>
					studentNames will need to hold text, testScores	and testCount will both hold numbers.	
				</section>
				<section>
					Students can only do whole numbers of tests, they can't take 3.6 tests.	
				</section>
				<section>
					testCount will need to be an integer.			
				</section>
				<section>
					Nothing says students cannot be awarded half marks.			
				</section>
				<section>
					testScores should be a floating point
