	<section><h2>Step 0 -</h2><h1>The Problem</h1></section>
	<section>
		<p>Ms Drouillard is French Teacher. She runs short courses that have between 7 and 10 students in each class. 
			She sets tests every week that are scored out of 30.</p>
		<p>Students must acheive a score of at least 10 to pass each test and points are only recorded if the student passes the test. Score are always whole numbers.</p>
		<p>Students need to achieve a total of 50 points to pass the course.</p>
	</section>
	<section>
		<p>She has asked you to make a system that does the following:
			<ul>
				<li>Holds the names of all students in the class.</li>
				<li>Allows her to enter a grade for ever student each week.</li>
				<li>Confirms each grade entered.</li>
				<li>Increases the total points for students who passed the test.</li>		
				<li>Produces a list of students who have complete the course.</li>
			</ul>					
		</p>

	<section><h2>Step 1 -</h2><h1>Data Structures</h1></section>			
	<section><h2>Thinking Points</h2></section>
	<section>The first task is to decide on the Data Structures you will need. Can you list out what is needed?</section>
	<section>Think about the variables you will need. Can you name these so they match the scenario?</section>
	<section>Next what data type will be best? Do you have enough information to get specific about data types? Or do you need to use data types that allow more of a range of information to be entered.</section>
	<section>Will each variable hold one piece of information or a set? </section>		
	<section><h2>Building Points</h2></section>
	<section>You will need to hold information on
		<ul>
			<li>Students Names</li>
			<li>Total Test Scores</li>
		</ul>
	</section>
	<section>I would make 2 variables <br>
		<ul>
			<li>studentNames</li>
			<li>testScores</li>
		</ul>
	</section>
	<section>
		Both will be arrays to hold more than one item.
	</section>
	<section>
		studentNames will need to hold text, and testScores will hold numbers.	
	</section>
	<section>
		Students cannot be awarded half marks.			
	</section>
	<section>
		testScores should be a integer 			
	</section>
	<section>
		I would initialise student names to an empty array.		
	</section>
	<section>
		I would initialise test scores to an array with 10 slots.		
	</section>
	<section>
		<pre><code>public static void Main (string[] args) {
	string[] studentNames = new string[10];
	int[] testScores = new int[] {};
}</code></pre>					
	</section>
</section>
<section>			
	<section><h2>Step 2 -</h2><h1>Indentifying Functions</h1></section>			
	<section><h2>Thinking Points</h2></section>
	<section>We next need to break the solution down into functions. Can you list out what functions will be needed?</section>
	<section>Each function should do a task, what tasks does the solution need to do?</section>
	<section><h2>Building Points</h2></section>
	<section>We can break our solution down into 3 main parts</section>
	<section>The 3 Parts are inputNames, inputScores and displayStudentsWhoPassed</section>
	<section>
		<pre><code>public static void Main (string[] args) {
	...
}

/*
static void inputNames()
{	}

static void inputNames()
{	}

static void displayStudentsWhoPassed()
{	}
*/
</code></pre>	Note - these are commented out as more will need to be done before these are anywhere near functional.			
	</section>
</section>
<section>			
	<section><h2>Step 3 -</h2><h1>Dummy Functions</h1></section>			
	<section><h2>Thinking Points</h2></section>
	<section>
		Next we need to set up the functions with the following information:<br>
		<ul>
			<li>Any information the function needs from the main program.</li>
			<li>What information the function needs to return to the main program.</li>
			<li>The Data Type of any information being returned.</li>
			<li>Some dummy information that could be returned by the function while we are producing the program.</li>
		</ul>
